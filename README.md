# 👋👋👋 Welcome! 
My name is Shreyas Donti, and I'm a sophomore at the University of Massachusetts Amherst pursuing a double major in Computer Science & Electrical Engineering. Nice to meet you!

I'm interested in everything tech - from video game development to programming languages - to hardware and machine learning. If it's tech, I want to learn more! I'm currently learning PyTorch and TensorFlow, and the basics of network programming!
